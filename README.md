## Lessons
What I learnt/noticed each day:
1. Look out for ambiguous edge cases.
2. Using enumerate is almost always a good idea.
3. Always check boundary data.
4. Simple solutions can be so clean.
5. Try looking at the problem from a different angle when stuck.
6. I wish all maths was this easy.
7. Card games are always fun.
8. Watch out for patterns and cycles...
9. Recursion is both the best and the worst at the same time.
10. Try to think of equivalent real-life examples (especially in soul-destroying puzzles)
11. Simplified problem; simplified solution.
12. I've gotta explore dynamic programming more.
13. Limit spaghetti code when there are many cases to deal with.
14. Pin-point those cycles accurately!
15. A long puzzle explanation doesn't always make for a hard problem, thankfully.
16. Ah, the final straightforward puzzle until the end.
17. Turning a puzzle into a graph as much as possible can be very helpful (plus knowing searching algorithms).
18. Well the shoelace formula is extremely helpful.
19. Who knew learning your lessons could be so helpful?
20. I mean that's just like trying to construct redstone circuits.
21. Look out for mathematically modelling when trying to detect cycles.
22. When code is getting messy, stop and restructure (or completely rewrite).
23. Get mroe confortable at adapting searching algorithms (here DFS).
24. Think carefully about how to apply maths (before starting to write code).
25. Networkx is brilliant!
